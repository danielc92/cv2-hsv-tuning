# cv2 Image Scan
Tuning HSV values to find objects of particular colour ranges using cv2/python3.

# Before you get started
- Understanding of basic python
- HSV colour space

# Setup
**How to obtain this repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielc92/cv2-hsv-tuning.git
```
**Modules/dependencies:**
- `cv2`

Install the following dependences:
```sh
pip install cv2
```

Running:
- Set the path in `main.py` to your image
- Enter `python3 main.py` in terminal
- Move sliders in trackbar to view resulting contours/mask

# Tests
- Showing original image, mask and result on screen dynamically
- Moving trackbar sliders to locate object of interest

### Trackbar GUI
GUI for variable input. Includes HSV upper and lower values as well as a range for size of contours to include in Frame.

### Frame
Shows original image with contour layer overlay.
